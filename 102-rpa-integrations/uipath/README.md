### Detailed description:

The UiPath plugin for Control-M enables the integration of UiPath RPAs with the rest of your application 
ecosystem, allowing for a true hyper automated application stack. True enterprise orchestration enables continuous SLA and business
process management.

UiPath is a cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows 
for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale.

Hyper automation allows for orchestrating a multitude of steps across business processes. In the context of data RPAs
this means that a data source may be the start of a RPA but it is not the starting point of a business process.
A number of steps would be performed prior to a data RPA being triggered. Prior steps could be application based where the data 
source is generated as an output from the application. Automating the end to end process provides clear and decisive 
visibility and management of the entire ecosystem, bonding RPAs with supplying applications.

* #### 3. Return the results of the RPA steps to the output in the Control-M Monitoring domain.  

* #### 4. Integrate Azure RPA runs with all existing Control-M capabilities.  
    For example : 
                   
        a. Have your RPA tasks defined in JSON and managed by your cicd process.          
        b. Attach SLA's to your RPA.
        c. Wait for a b2b source to arrive and process it in an application and run a RPA based on the outcome.
        d. Attach prior and post dependancy steps to your RPA for a fully encompassed view of your environment.
        e. A single reference point for the entire lifecycle of your data, from creation to analytics.

* #### 5. Avoid connection timeouts and unnecessary RPA reruns
